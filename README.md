🏥 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

🌟 Project Overview

Diabetes is a serious health condition that affects millions worldwide. Early detection can help in better management and prevention of complications. This project leverages Machine Learning (Support Vector Machine - SVM) to predict whether a person is diabetic based on various medical parameters. The goal is to create an efficient and accurate predictive model using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and data preprocessing techniques.

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project (diabetes_data.csv) contains 8 medical attributes and 1 target variable:

Feature

Description

Pregnancies

Number of times pregnant

Glucose

Blood sugar level

BloodPressure

Blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness

Skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin

Insulin level (mu U/ml)

BMI

Body Mass Index

DiabetesPedigreeFunction

Genetic diabetes risk factor

Age

Age of the person

Outcome

1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic

⚙️ Tech Stack Used

✔ Programming Language: Python 🐍✔ Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn✔ Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)✔ Jupyter Notebook for implementation

🚀 How to Run the Project

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed and install the required dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter

Steps to Execute

1️⃣ Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git

2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder:

cd diabetes-prediction

3️⃣ Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

4️⃣ Open Diabetese_Prediction.ipynb and execute all cells.

📈 Model Training & Evaluation

The dataset is preprocessed using StandardScaler to normalize feature values.

The data is split into 80% training and 20% testing to evaluate performance.

The SVM Classifier is trained on the dataset.

Accuracy Score is used to evaluate the model's performance.

🔥 Future Enhancements

🔹 Try alternative models like Random Forest, Decision Trees, Neural Networks.🔹 Tune hyperparameters for improved accuracy.🔹 Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit.
